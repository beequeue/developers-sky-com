## Approving Submissions

Once you've submitted your pull post on the slack channel to inform of a new pull request. Anyone can approve a request assuming it meets the above guidelines, for approval simply add a :+1: as a comment. For the pull request to be ready for merge you require 2x :+1:, the final person to :+1: can merge the request.

### Merge Conflicts

Ask the owner of the branch to pull and update. Once the merge has been resolved you can give approval based on the above guidelines. If the pull request has an initial :+1: but then ends up conflicted, after resolution only 1 more :+1: is required for the branch to be approved and merged.

If the branch is out of date after the first :1+: and canâ€™t be fast forwarded, ask the owner of the PR to resolve conflict and notify when complete. After a merge only 1 additional :+1: is required if one has already been obtained.
