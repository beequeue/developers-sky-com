# Sky Developers Portal

A developers portal, in the open.  For developers at Sky (past, present and future) and by developers at Sky.

## So, you want to write a blog post?

Great! You really should and it's easy to do. Don't get put off if you've never done this sort of thing before.

You'll need to do a little bit of work with GitHub as our approval process uses the standard GitHub pull request process.

## Getting Started

For those familiar with git and github pull requests, skip forward to installing Jekyll.

* Create a [github account](https://github.com/join) if you don't have one. Any standard github account will do, you don’t need special permissions

* Ensure you're running a [git client](http://git-scm.com/downloads) then ensure [you've set it up](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)

* [Fork our repository and clone it to your machine](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

* [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) if you want to preview your blog post. If you don’t want to preview, then don’t worry about Jekyll. On a machine with [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download), it's super quick

```
gem install jekyll
```

* Run jekyll from within your cloned project

```
jekyll serve
```
