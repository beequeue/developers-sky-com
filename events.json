This talk will take you through the lessons we learnt following one unfortunate event in 2014 which led NOW TV to catastrophic failure, and the improvements and scalability challenges we were faced with when preparing for the same event just 1 year later. Hear how we turned our entire failure case behaviour on its head; from always failing in favour of NOW TV, to failing in favour of the customer. Learn how we ensure that high availability of video assets on the CDN ensures continued playout irrespective of the state of our application servers.</p>"
