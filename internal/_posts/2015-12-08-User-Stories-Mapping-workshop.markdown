* Are you building features the customers really want to use?
* Does your project team have a high level of shared understanding?
* Do you feel that there is always too much code to write and not enough time and resources available?


If you find any of the questions above might be relevant to your team then User Story Mapping can be a good way to approach your User Stories workshop

### The Workshop
On the 10th of December we will run a User Story mapping workshop at the SNS office in London
to learn the main aspects of the Story Mapping approach as described by Jeff Patton on his milestone book: 
[http://www.amazon.co.uk/User-Story-Mapping-Discover-Product/dp/1491904909], 
have fun and get used to collaborate together; Developers, Product Owners and anyone with a  stake on the success of your product.

Stay tuned for more updates!
