* Are you building features the customers really want to use?
* Does your project team have a high level of shared understanding?
* Do you feel that there is always too much code to write and not enough time and resources available?

As the questions above are relevant to many Product Development teams, 
to address them we explored the User Story Mapping as a way to approach User Stories workshop

## The Workshop
On the 22nd of October and on the 10th of December 2015 we run a User Story Mapping workshop 
in the Sky campus in Osterley and at the SNS office in London 
User Story Mapping can help Scrum Master, Developers, Product Owners and anyone with a stake 
on the success of our products

### *#1*
First we broke into many table and we asked each table to break down they morning routine into tasks
then we ordered the task on a map following the narrative flow (X) and details (Y) dimensions,
the outcome looked something like the picture below:

### *#2*
Next, we learned about grouping tasks, typically expressed in terms subjective to the person 
describing them, in high level **Activities**.
Activities are described in a way everyone can relate to in the same way and are a great tool to 
describe the high level narrative of a journey into a product (**Backbone**)

### *#3*
Once you have grown a model of your product you can start to focus on defining **desired outcomes**. 
They are used to drive collaborative conversations, refining the map in a way conducive 
to fulfil specific goals
Desired outcome are a great way to focus drive an **MVP** approach or more in general to facilitate release planning

## The examples

* Sky Campus workshop
On this workshop we built map to model morning task routines
The MVP scenario was “Alarm did not go off, need to get out of the house in 10 minutes, what is the minimum set of task I have to do?” 
* SNS workshop:
We built maps to model the feature on the Facebook web app
The MVP scenario was “we have a meeting with potential investors in a week, what is the minimum set of features I have to build to prove the strength of the platform?” 

You can practice story mapping with any kind of product or process, 
A good exercise you can do right away is start modelling your own team app, 
you might be surprised by what you learn!

## What have we learnt?

An important point of the session is to understand the need to minimise development effort while maximizing the outcome for your users:

> There is never enough time and resources to build everything you want

And also:

> Product Development is not about building software but about changing the world with useful outcomes

Main concepts explored:

* Stories/tasks

* Activities

* Backbone

* Personas

* Splitting the map

* MVP 

* Sprints

* Release Roadmap

That’s all!
