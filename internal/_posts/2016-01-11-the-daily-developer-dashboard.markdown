## What is the Daily Developer Dashboard (DDD)?
The DDD is a dashboard for surfacing useful data to developers at Sky. This can take the form of key information, like data on watched Git repositories or upcoming events. It also makes the daily essentials more accessible.  For example, the trains tile allows the user to see train times at a glance and the one-click menus are far more efficient than the foodatsky equivalent.  
  
The key feature of the DDD, however, is giving users customisability and control.  The user can choose which tiles are displayed and which are not. They can also arrange the tile configuration as they please, by dragging the tiles to the desired positions. The DDD then remembers this configuration for the next time the user logs in.  
  
This control extends to the events page where any user can add an event, which will then be viewable by all users, and to the Git repositories a user chooses to view.  
  
If you haven't yet seen the DDD, you can log in with Sky credentials at [https://ddd.sky.com](https://ddd.sky.com).  
  
## What is the road map of the DDD?
The future of the DDD is open source. The vision of the DDD is that any developer at Sky should be able to create their own tile, surfacing data they need, and add it to the DDD. This would help the DDD by giving it a greater appeal, but would also make it a better tool, allowing it to meet its user's needs as they see them.  
  
To this end we have written extensive documentation and provided a Yeoman tile generator to assist any one who wants to do this.   

## The Hack Day

This is where the Hack Day comes in.  
  
We wanted a way to engage people with the DDD and encourage the creation of new tiles. We also wanted to test the documentation and ensure that it wouldn't be prohibitive to developers wanting to add features and tiles. We decided a Hack Day would be the best way to do this, so we broadcasted the details and offered a prize for the hack.    
  
On the day itself we had a good number of people turn up ready to hack. And by the end of the day they had a lot to show for it.  
  
## The results
The following new tiles/features were created:  

* A meme generator tile that allows you to enter text and select an image
* A tile to surface blogs from developers.sky.com (this site)
* An Electron desktop app for the DDD
* Significant steps towards a Sky Buses tile
* A tile that surfaces data from Trello
  
Although a number of these are incomplete or need polishing, you should expect to see these arriving on the DDD in the near future. In the end the winners were the developers.sky.com team, but it was a hard decision.  
  
Thanks to everyone who helped organise the day and congratulations to the team for a worthy win (pictured below, with their prizes).

If you have a tile or feature you want to see added to the DDD, the place to start is our [Github repo](https://github.com/) and [the wiki there](https://github.com/sky-uk/ddd/wiki). Or you can always post in the [ddd Slack channel](https://sky.slack.com/messages/ddd/team/).
